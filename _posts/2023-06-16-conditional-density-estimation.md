summary: CDE is the process of estimating the probability density function of a random variable given the values other variables.
---

<p><div align="justify">Typically, when we seek to model the relationship between a target variable $Y\in\mathbb{R}$ and one or more covariates $X$, our goal is to establish a conditional-expectation type association. Mathematically, if we define our loss as the mean squared error, our explicit aim is to identify the function $\mathbb{E} \left( Y \,|\, X=x\right)$. This function intuitively gives a prediction of the average value of $Y$ given that the covariates are $X=x$. Despite the straightforward and simplified summary provided by point estimates, they often fail to encapsulate the inherent intricacies and uncertainties prevalent in most real-world predictive scenarios. This prompts us to ask: Is the variance around this average value extensive, or can we confidently anticipate the value to be in close proximity to the predicted one?</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">Diverging from the conventional approach of a single point estimation, Conditional Density Estimation (CDE) aims to understand the plausibility of an entire range of potential outcomes given specific input data. In mathematical terms, we are estimating the probability density function $f \left( y \,|\, X=x \right)$.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">The holistic nature of CDE affords a deeper understanding of data characteristics and proves beneficial in addressing two fundamental aspects: evaluating model trustworthiness outcomes and accommodating multi-modal.</div></p>

1. <p><div align="justify"><strong>Model Trustworthiness:</strong> Unlike point estimation predictions, which offer no insight into their own reliability or uncertainty, CDE provides a full distribution of potential outcomes, thereby inherently conveying information about prediction confidence. The varaince of the predicted distribution can act as a measure of uncertainty or confidence, affording users a more comprehensive understanding of the predictions. Such an understanding proves critical when making decisions based on these predictions. For instance, in the healthcare sector, a prediction about patient outcomes accompanied by an understanding of its confidence or uncertainty could lead to more informed and suitable medical decisions.</div></p>

2. <p><div align="justify"><strong>Multi-modal outcomes:</strong> Traditional regression or classification problems, generally focused on single point predictions, often fall short in capturing the full complexity of real-world phenomena. This shortfall becomes particularly apparent when a single input could feasibly yield multiple valid outputs, a situation termed as multi-modality. Consider a task of predicting salary based on certain features, but we're unsure if the individual resides in a state with a high or low average salary. In such a context, a more nuanced salary estimate shouldn't merely be an average drawn from both regions. Rather, it would be more fitting to present a bi-modal distribution with two distinct peaks. Each peak would denote a plausible salary range for the individual, depending on whether they live in one state or another.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">$\oint$ <em>The field of conformal predictions aims to address this uncertainty by estimating confidence intervals $IC(X=x)$ around the model's predictions, such that $Y\,|\,X=x \in IC(X=x)$ with a certain desired confidence level [<a href="#bibliography">1</a>]. Interpreting the confidence interval begins to address some of the queries we raised earlier. However, having only the interval extremes (which are naturally attempts to estimate conditional quantiles) doesn't fully portray the uncertainty associated with your prediction. This limitation is particularly evident when dealing with multi-modal densities or if you have a utility metric associated with your predictions and aim to examine the average utility for an individual, the logical approach would be to perform an integral on the individual's probability density.</em></div></p>

## Creating the dataset

<p><div align="justify">Let's construct a simple illustrative problem to explore the application of non-parametric techniques in the context of CDE. Consider a data generating process of the following form:</div></p>

$$X\sim\textrm{Uniform}(0, 1),$$

$$\left(Y \,|\, X=x\right) \sim \sin\left(2\pi x\right) + \mathcal{N}\left(0, \sigma\left(x\right)\right),$$

<p><div align="justify">where $\sigma(x) = 0.3 - 0.25 \sin(2\pi x)$.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">In this instance, $X$ is one-dimensional primarily for the purpose of visualization, although our discussion is applicable regardless of the dimensionality of $X$.</div></p>

```python
def mean_function(X):
    return np.sin(2 * np.pi * X)

def deviation_function(X):
    return 0.3 + 0.25 * mean_function(X)

def generate_data_with_normal_noise(
    mean_generator, deviation_generator, size=5_000, random_state=None
):
    def normal_noise_generator(X, deviation_generator, random_state=None):
        noise = np.random.RandomState(random_state).normal(
            loc=0, scale=deviation_generator(X)
        )
        return noise

    rs = np.random.RandomState(random_state).randint(
        0, 2**32 - 1, dtype=np.int64, size=2
    )
    X = np.random.RandomState(rs[0]).uniform(size=size)
    y_pred = mean_generator(X=X)
    noise = normal_noise_generator(
        X=X, deviation_generator=deviation_generator, random_state=rs[1]
    )
    y_pred_noisy = y_pred + noise

    return X, y_pred_noisy

X, y = generate_data_with_normal_noise(
    mean_generator=mean_function,
    deviation_generator=deviation_function,
    random_state=42,
)
```

<p><div align="justify">By the design of the data, the conditional density is influenced by the covariates in both the mean and the variance.</div></p>

```python
x_grid = np.linspace(0, 1, 1000)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 3))
ax.plot(x_grid, mean_function(x_grid), color="C0", label="Mean function")
ax.fill_between(
    x_grid,
    mean_function(x_grid) - 1.96 * deviation_function(x_grid),

## Histograms

<p><div align="justify">The task of density estimation may initially seem daunting, but in reality, it becomes quite intuitive once we recognize that a histogram (normalized to have an integral of 1) is effectively a technique aimed at achieving this objective. By counting the number of examples in each bin, we discretize the distribution, enabling us to estimate the probability of the regions and thus obtain a "low-resolution" density estimation.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify"><center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/conditional_density_estimation/output_8_0.png"></center></div></p>

<p><div align="justify">However, employing all samples only yields a density estimate of $Y$ without imposing any condition on $X$.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">We can easily condition this strategy on $X=x$ by only including points in proximity to $X=x$ when generating the histogram that will represent the conditional density. The definition of "proximity" can be flexible. For instance, we could use a strategy like <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors.html#sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors.radius_neighbors"><code>sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors.radius_neighbors</code></a>, which selects only the examples that reside within a radius of $\varepsilon$ from point $x$, or we could select a fixed number of nearest neighbors using a method like <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors.html#sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors.kneighbors"><code>sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors.kneighbors</code></a>.</div></p>

## Kernel Density Estimation

<p><div align="justify">While histograms serve as excellent baselines, they can pose challenges for more intricate distributions. Determining the appropriate number of bins can prove difficult, and we may end up with stair-step functions that aren't the most manageable to work with.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">In general, the problem of non-parametric density estimation is frequently tackled using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), and it is logical to use it here too, aligning it with a strategy to convert the problem into a conditional estimation. The essential concept of KDE is to place "bumps" around observed points (shaped like a Gaussian, for instance) and then sum these bumps, normalizing them to yield a density estimate.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">$\oint$ <em>The nature of the bump (which is called a kernel) and the width (bandwidth) of these bumps are hyperparameters that can be tuned using cross-validation with a likelihood-style metric to assess the likelihood of a test sample having been drawn from your estimated density [<a href="#bibliography">2</a>].</em></div></p>

<p><div align="justify"><center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/conditional_density_estimation/output_12_0.png"></center></div></p>

<p><div align="justify">To condition our KDE, we can once again use a neighbor search. Utilizing <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors.html"><code>sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors</code></a> and <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KernelDensity.html"><code>sklearn.neighbors.KernelDensity</code></a> (without being overly concerned about this model's hyperparameters), we can identify the neighbors closest to a specific point, say $X=0.2$, and then estimate the density using these neighbors.</div></p>

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors, KernelDensity

x_value = 0.2
knn = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=100).fit(X.reshape(-1, 1))

## Evaluation metrics for conditional density estimation methods

<p><div align="justify">Clearly, applying traditional regression metrics directly here can be challenging, necessitating an approach specific to the problem we're addressing. This discussion is a bit more involved, but it's critical for evaluating our estimators.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">$\oint$ <em>Certain metrics from conformal prediction could be utilized here, like "how often the observed target falls within a confidence interval", if you construct confidence intervals from the estimated conditional densities. However, metrics inherently suited to the nature of the problem are more suitable.</em></div></p>

<p><div align="justify">Let's denote the true conditional probability density of the problem as $f(y \,|\, X=x)$, and the estimated density as $\hat{f}(y \,|\, X=x)$. We want to gauge how close these two functions are, even though we don't have $f(y | x)$. A smart way to handle this is to compute the mean square error of the difference [<a href="#bibliography">3</a>]</div></p>

$$ L(f, \hat{f}) = \mathbb{E}_X\left( \int \left( \hat{f}(y \,|\, X) - f(y \,|\, X) \right)^2 dy \right) = \int \int \left( \hat{f}(y \,|\, X=x) - f(y \,|\, X=x) \right)^2  dy \, f(x) \, dx.$$

<p><div align="justify">$\oint$ <em>This metric differs somewhat from the mean square error as empirical risk for our point estimates $h(x)$. When we calculate $\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( h(x_i) - y_i \right)$, we're effectively estimating.</em></div></p>

$$\mathbb{E}_{(X, Y)}\left( h(X) - Y \right) = \int \int \left( h(x) - y \right)^2 f(x,y) \, dx \, dy.$$

<p><div align="justify"><em>In the metric $L$, we average only with respect to $X$, so that, for a fixed $X=x$, we want $\hat{f}(y \,|\, X=x)$ to approximate $f(y \,|\, X=x)$ well for all possible $y$ values uniformly in $\mathbb{R}$.</em></div></p>

<p><div align="justify">Upon expanding $L$, we obtain</div></p>

$$ L(f, \hat{f}) = \int \int \left( \hat{f}(y \,|\, X=x) \right)^2 f(x) \, dy \, dx + \int \int -2\hat{f}(y \,|\, X=x) f(y, x) dx dy + C,$$

<p><div align="justify">where $f(x,y) = f(y \,|\, x) f(x)$ and $C$ is defined as $C = \int \int \left( f(y \,|\, x) \right)^2 f(x) \, dy \, dx$. As $C$ is a constant independent of the estimation method of $\hat{f}$, it can be disregarded when comparing models.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">The first term can be written as</div></p>

$$ \int \left( \int \left( \hat{f}(y \,|\, X=x) \right)^2\, dy \right) f(x)  \, dx, $$

<p><div align="justify">The second term can be directly estimated as the empirical average</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">where a good model should yield as small a value as possible [<a href="#bibliography">3</a>].</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">$\oint$ <em>It's intriguing to casually interpret this final expression we obtained.

<p><div align="justify">In this case, we achieve a better score than before using any value of neighbors. However, we could still be interested in aspects of kernel estimation, which could further enhance the result.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">The <code>ConditionalNearestNeighborsKDE</code> structure was proposed as it is more intuitive. Nonetheless, in higher dimensions or in scenarios with a lot of data, the neighbor search can encounter certain issues. Firstly, it's computationally costly due to the requirement for distance comparisons. Secondly, we might easily be at the mercy of varying scales of variables, potentially including categorical variables. Thirdly, we might have many less informative variables in $X$ and consequently suffer from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality">curse of dimensionality</a>, with our neighbors becoming increasingly distant and less representative. In a real-world problem, you might have hundreds of covariates you wish to condition on and millions of examples, making this strategy possibly less suitable.</div></p>

## LeafNeighbors

<p><div align="justify">A potential way to bypass the complications posed by neighbor searches in high dimensions, such as irrelevant variables, and varied scales and types is to formulate a more suitable distance metric robust to these challenges.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">The manner in which tree training is conducted naturally equips it to tackle these issues effectively because: tree models learn what the important features are through the process of choosing the best splits; and they are not concerned about the scale of variables, as they focus only on the ordering during training.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">When training a bagging of trees, we see variability in splits across the feature space, enabling us to use co-occurrence in the same leaves as a measure of similarity between examples [<a href="#bibliography">4</a>].</div></p>
<p><div align="justify">Hence, if we train a bagging model of regression trees like <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html"><code>sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor</code></a> or <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor.html"><code>sklearn.ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor</code></a> to predict $Y$ from $X$, we are inherently constructing trees that create splits in relevant variables for predicting $Y$. At the same time, we disregard different scales by considering all instances that occur in the same leaf as similar, achieved by counting the co-occurrences of leaves across different models in the bagging [<a href="#bibliography">5</a>].</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">We can design a neighbor search class following this rationale, in accordance with the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html">scikit-learn standards</a>.</div></p>

```python

## FlexCode

<p><div align="justify">FlexCode takes a fundamentally different approach to the CDE problem by employing arguments from linear algebra to estimate the conditional probability density function using a function basis.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">The space of <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/L2-Space.html">square integrable functions</a> ($L^2(\mathbb{R})$) is a vector space equipped with an inner product defined as $\left\langle g, h\right\rangle = \int_{\mathbb{R}} g(t)\, h(t) \, dt$. Similar to finite-dimensional vector spaces, it possesses a (in this case, infinite) basis $\{ \phi_i \in L^2(\mathbb{R}) : i \in \mathbb{N}\}$, where any function $g \in L^2(\mathbb{R})$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis elements: $g(t) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \beta_i \phi_i(t)$, for all $t \in \mathbb{R}$. Furthermore, it is possible to impose an orthonormal condition on the basis, such that $\left\langle \phi_i, \phi_j\right\rangle = \delta_{i,j}$, where $\delta_{i,j}$ equals $1$ if $i = j$ and $0$ otherwise [<a href="#bibliography">3</a>]. To help illustrate this concept, if you are unfamiliar with it, consider the analogy to the application of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series">Fourier series</a>.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">With any fixed orthonormal basis $\{ \phi_i \}$, it is possible to express the conditional probability density function as follows [<a href="#bibliography">3</a>]:</div></p>

$$f(y \,|\, X=x) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \beta_i(x)\, \phi_i(y),$$

<p><div align="justify">In this formulation, we explicitly incorporate the dependence of $X=x$ within the coefficients of the linear combination.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">It is worth noting that due to the orthonormality of the basis $\{ \phi_i \}$, we have the following property:</div></p>

$$
\begin{align*}
    \mathbb{E}\left( \phi_j(Y) \,|\, X=x \right) &= \int_\mathbb{R} \phi_j(y) \,f(y \,|\, X=x) \,dy\\
    &= \int_\mathbb{R} \phi_j(y) \sum_{i=1}^\infty \beta_i(x)\, \phi_i(y) \,dy\\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^\infty \beta_i(x) \int_\mathbb{R} \phi_j(y) \, \phi_i(y) \,dy\\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^\infty \beta_i(x) \,\delta_{i,j} = \beta_j(x).
\end{align*}
$$

<p><div align="justify">Hence, the estimation of $\hat{\beta}_j(x)$ can be achieved through regression, utilizing $X$ as predictors to estimate $\phi_j(Y)$.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">The <a href="https://pypi.org/project/flexcode/">FlexCode</a> algorithm [<a href="#bibliography">3</a>] adopts this approach. By employing a designated <code>basis_system</code> (a hyperparameter of the model), the algorithm estimates the coefficients using regressions of $\phi_j(Y)$. Since computing the infinite sum is not practical, it is truncated at a specified value, <code>max_basis</code> denoted as $I$ (which can be determined through cross-validation as a hyperparameter). Consequently, we obtain the following expression:</div></p>

$$ \hat{f}(y \,|\, X=x) = \sum_{i=1}^I \hat{\beta}_i(x) \, \phi(y).$$

## Using FlexCode in Python

<p><div align="justify">To utilize FlexCode, we first need to define the regression model along with its parameters, as well as the previously mentioned hyperparameters.</div></p>

    regression_params={"max_depth": 5, "n_estimators": 100},
)
flexcode_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

<p><div align="justify">As implemented, the estimator returns the value of $\hat{f}(y \,|\, X=x)$ on a grid of $y$ values.</div></p>

```python
cdes, y_grid_flexcode = flexcode_model.predict(X_test, n_grid=400)
y_grid_flexcode = y_grid_flexcode.reshape(-1)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 3))
for c, sample_index in enumerate(np.random.RandomState(13).choice(len(X_test), size=3)):
    x_value = np.round(X_test[sample_index], 4)
    ax.plot(
        y_grid_refined,
        norm(loc=mean_function(x_value), scale=deviation_function(x_value)).pdf(
            y_grid_refined
        ),
        "--",
        color=f"C{c}",
        label=f"real $f(y | x = {x_value})$",
    )
    ax.plot(

        cdes[sample_index],
        color=f"C{c}",
        label=f"estimated $f(y | x = {x_value})$ using flexcode",

## Final considerations

<p><div align="justify">Delving deeper into regression problems, beyond simple point estimates, can be challenging. However, this approach provides a wealth of insightful information that can enhance your decision-making process. While it's a significant area of study, it has not yet become a primary focus within the community. Nonetheless, I anticipate a surge of interest as more individuals realize its value.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">Currently, the libraries designed to address these intricate problems are being refined, with issues being resolved over time. Therefore, when utilizing these tools, it's essential to exercise caution and promptly report any anomalous behavior observed.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">$\oint$ <em>I cared to mention the tree-based neighbor method because it is possible to adapt the tree training in a specific way for the CDE problems. Typically, in regression problems, a decision tree would aim to optimize a particular metric such as <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error.html"><code>sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error</code></a> when establishing its splits. However, for CDE problems, there's a possibility to optimize a CDE-specific metric directly within the splits. One such metric could be the CDE <code>squared_loss</code> we implemented earlier. This approach is what the <a href="https://github.com/lee-group-cmu/RFCDE">RFCDE (Random Forests for Conditional Density Estimation)</a> method suggests [<a href="#bibliography">6</a>].</em></div></p>
