## Personal Blogs

<p><div align="justify"> &bull; <a href="https://karpathy.ai/">Andrej Karpathy's blog</a>: Probably the most didactic videos on practical use of deep learning on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy">YouTube channel</a>.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify"> &bull; <a href="https://lgmoneda.github.io/">Luis Moneda's blog</a>: Super interesting posts about out-of-distribution generalization and the best texts I've ever seen so far on career/management in data science on his <a href="https://datascienceleadership.com/">DS leadership material</a>.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify"> &bull; <a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/">Lilian Weng's blog</a>: In-depth articles on deep learning, presenting complex concepts with clarity and detailed explanations.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify"> &bull; <a href="https://maxhalford.github.io/">Max Halford's blog</a>: Very interesting posts about various aspects of data science, from database queries to using online models with streaming data.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify"> &bull; <a href="https://matheusfacure.github.io/">Matheus Facure's blog</a>: The causal inference posts and the basic tutorials are really didatic and useful.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify"> &bull; <a href="https://takeshimg92.github.io/">Alessandro Takeshi's blog</a>: Physicists love to solve difficult equations. Alessandro is a physicist. Jokes aside, although the posts are not trivial, they are much more digestible than the places where the ideas come from!</div></p>

<p><div align="justify"> &bull; <a href="https://gdmarmerola.github.io/">Guilherme Marmerola's blog</a>: A great place to discover different and elegant approaches. Any visual resemblance to this blog is purely coincidental!</div></p>

<p><div align="justify"> &bull; <a href="https://almeida-caio.github.io/">Caio Almeida's blog</a>: Despite Caio being a physicist (not everyone is perfect), he is one of the most intelligent people I've had the opportunity to interact with.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify"> &bull; <a href="https://matheusjorge.github.io/">Matheus Jorge's blog</a>: Alexandr.IA is an didatic resource for those who are having their first contact with some topic.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify"> &bull; <a href="https://raphaeltamaki.github.io/raphaeltamaki/">Raphael Tamaki's blog</a>: Very interesting posts about predicting customer lifetime value.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify"> &bull; <a href="https://robotenique.github.io/">Juliano Garcia's blog</a>: Whenever I need to take averages of circular quantities (like the time of the day), I visit this blog.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify"> &bull; <a href="https://tabacof.github.io/">Pedro Tabacof's blog</a>: General discussions around machine learning.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify"> &bull; <a href="https://huyenchip.com/blog/">Chip Huyen's blog</a>: Lots of interesting material on machine learning in production.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify"> &bull; <a href="https://alex.smola.org/blog.html">Alex Smola's blog</a>: Despite him not updating his blog for a while, the content is still very rich, and I have a special affection for his post on covariate shift.</div></p>

## Books

<p><div align="justify"> &bull; <a href="http://ciml.info/">A Course in Machine Learning</a>: One of the best references for a first approach to Machine Learning techniques! Hal Daum√© III manages to order the subjects in a logical and interesting way and provokes you to make the right reflections. After reading part of it, you can study the algorithms it doesn't cover with a deep understanding of what's going on. It is a modern book that is concerned with discussing relevant topics such as Fairness.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify"> &bull; <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/mlbook/">Foundations of Machine Learning</a>: If you want to delve into the details of Learning Theory, I highly recommend this book. Mohri discusses in depth the learning objectives, defining clearly and mathematically what we mean when we say that the algorithm "learned" through PAC-learning. It clearly motivates the minimization of empirical risk by rigorously defining the notions of complexity (with Rademacher's and VC-dimension). It's a very theoretical book, but it immerses you in the philosophy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam's razor</a>.</div></p>

## Courses

<p><div align="justify"> &bull; <a href="https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html">Learning from Data</a>: Yaser Abu-Mostafa tricks you by translating complex subjects in a simple and didactic way. It's a great introduction to the same notions presented in Mohri's book, but in a visual way with lots of cool examples. It's a very cool deepening for those who already know the basics of Machine Learning and want to see the theory that guarantees learning a little more rigorously.</div></p>
