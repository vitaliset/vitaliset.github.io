<p><div align="justify">Hi my name is Carlo, I'm 14 years old (I would have if I were alive), I died at 13 in Cascavel-PR. In addition to haunting, I'm an (almost surely) mathematician enthusiastic about data science!</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">$\oint$ <i>If you're not familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkut">brazilian Orkut culture</a>, you probably didn't understand the last reference. This used to be the beginning of a famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copypasta">copypasta</a> in Orkut communities that "forced" you (boomers and kids) to share it in more places for fearing of being killed by the haunting that would have written the <a href="https://cdn.mensagenscomamor.com/content/images/m000505417.jpg?v=1">text</a>. It would be funnier if I didn't have to explain the joke... :P</i></div></p>

<p><div align="justify">I decided to write this blog to learn how to expose my projects and discussions in a technical and formal way while being accessible to people with a knowledge of university mathematics and initial notions of Machine Learning. I try to be mathematically rigorous, but without losing the visual and intuitive part of what is happening.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">To learn more about my professional and academic experiences, you can see my <a href="https://github.com/vitaliset/vitaliset.github.io/blob/master/carlo_bach_ufabc.pdf">undergraduation grades</a>, my <a href="https://github.com/vitaliset/vitaliset.github.io/blob/master/carlo_cv.pdf">curriculum vitae</a> and my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlo-lemos">Linkedin</a>.</div></p>

<p><div align="justify">$\oint$ <i><b>Why Vitali Set?</b>: I really like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)">Measure Theory</a> (one of Probability's foundation). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitali_set">Vitali&#39;s set</a> is the classic example to motivate the formalization of these concepts: it is a set of $\mathbb{R}$ that it makes no sense for you to define a measure, when you restrict your measure to satisfy a few very reasonable conditions.</i></div></p>
