Hi! My name is **Guilherme Duarte Marmerola**, and I'm a Data Scientist from Brazil. 

I'm passionate about machine learning, and how it empowers us to solve tough problems in business and science. 

I had the fortune of discovering ML in my early undergraduate years, totally by chance, during an internship. Since then, Iâ€™ve fallen in love with it, and had a lot of fun building cool advanced analytics initiatives in many industries, such as media, mining, insurance, retail, consumer goods, banking and real estate.

I hold a special interest about some specific topics:

**Reinforcement learning and bayesian inference:** particurlarly, I'm interested in the exploration-exploitation dilemma, and how to solve it with (bayesian) models that capture uncertainty. I've devoted a lot of time to the study of bandit problems, and how to use them as frameworks to fundamental problems in industry (pricing, resource allocation, recommendation, and others).

**Dimensionality reduction and clustering:** how can we visualize and interpret structure in our data, aiming to explain it to business stakeholders? Can we do better than simple K-Means clustering and PCA? What similarity measures, algorithms and representations would make this possible?

**Causal Inference:** in industry, a sizeable chunk of projects start when someone in your organization asks for your help answering what-if questions such as: 
* *what would happen if we lowered prices?*
* *if we recommended product A instead of B, would our revenue grow?*
* *if we sent e-mails to our customers instead of calling them, what would happen to our conversion rate?*

All of these questions, no matter how varied, can be solved with causal inference methods. How can we go beyond Randomized Controlled Trials and A/B tests and extract value from observational data in these contexts?

**Management, and data science in a business context:** doing data science in industry is far from trivial. We need to balance time for experimentation with deadlines, data is oftentimes messy and stakeholders may not have a clear understanding of our work and challenges. How can you navigate this and deliver real value from ML, while maintaining the best people motivated?

I hope I can bring useful insights about these topics and others. Feel free to [contact me](https://gdmarmerola.github.io/contact), and also add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gdmarmerola/)!
